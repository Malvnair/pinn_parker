This repository implements a Physics-Informed Neural Network (PINN) model of the two-dimensional isothermal Parker instability in a vertically stratified, magnetized atmosphere. The model learns the time evolution of density, velocity, and magnetic field directly from the governing MHD equations, with the magnetic field represented via a vector potential to enforce the divergence-free constraint by construction.

Training outputs are stored in time-stamped run directories, including grid-based snapshots of the learned fields at discrete times. These snapshots can be post-processed to visualize magnetic field-line geometry (via contours of the vector potential) and velocity flow, providing physically meaningful diagnostics of magnetic buoyancy, gas drainage into valleys, and nonlinear growth. The project is intended as a research prototype to explore the strengths and limitations of PINNs for nonlinear MHD instabilities rather than a production solver.
